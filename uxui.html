      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <div class="WWH">The website in its current form is very static and so the task was to re-design it as a mobile application. The main goal was to make it <strong>a more engaging</strong>, <strong>responsive</strong> and <strong>effective </strong>environment for the users to share, swap and gift items.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>How?</h3>
      <div class="WWH">The design process, described below, focuses on the first cycle of <strong>user-centered design</strong> process, up to delivering an initial version of a high-fidelity prototype. <strong>Illustrator</strong> and <strong>Figma</strong> were used as the two main design and prototyping tools. Onenote, Zoom and WhatsApp were used for brainstorming, communication and collaboration.<br>
        I worked with my colleague Stephen and it was an equally divided team effort with my responsibilities falling more into <strong>user-research</strong> and <strong>prototyping</strong> and Stephen being responsible for <strong>information architecture</strong> and <strong>UI design</strong>.

The challange was to improve the user experience by converting the static environment of the website into a more social and interactive space and improve the usability by reducing the mental processing power needed to use the service. <br>
          <br>
          The service is clearly valuable to people, proven by the sincere Thank you messages published on their website. This inspired us to work on improving the user-experience to help bring the idea of sharing to even more people! </div>

    <p>We used flow diagram to mark out all major user-journeys and functions that we need to include to improve the user-experience and make the service more efficient. We started with hand-drawn variations and once we settled on all functionality we created Wireflow in Ilustrator. At the ideation stage, we used the crazy 8's design sprint method to first open up the design space and then pick the best fitting ideas for prototyping. This step was crucial in helping us approach the design stage in Figma with much clearer concept.</p>

      <div class="WWH" >With an ever-increasing number of people using mobile as their primary device for accessing information, this project was a <strong>usability evaluation</strong> of the Learning Management Software Sulis, specifically <strong>focusing on mobile use</strong>. </div>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <div class="WWH"> The data collected through usability testing produced <strong>valuable insights</strong> regarding usability of the software on mobile, as well as major <strong>pain points</strong> that were found while the users conducted the assigned tasks. <strong>The goal</strong> of the usability testing was to <strong>construct an overall understanding</strong> of the usability issues of the software, when used on a mobile device and to <strong>design recommendations</strong> for a structured way of addressing identified issues. </div>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>How?</h3>
      <div class="WWH">The usability testing was done using <strong>Neilsen's 10 usability heuristics</strong> to better structure and analyse the issues an <strong>affinity diagram</strong> was used to group the issues and collate the findings accross the groups to draw more effective conclusion. <strong>Qualitative and quantitative data</strong> was collected on the severity of the individual issues to evaluate what effect these issues have on the users’ interactions with the software.

For easier analysis, all the tests were recorded and notes were taken during the testing. We also encouraged users to voice their thoughts while completing the tasks. The think-aloud method gave us better insight into the thinking process of the user.<br> We also conducted a short interview before and after the testing to collect qualitative data about users opinions, feelings and use patterns of the software.</div>

        <div class="tableText">To analyse the data, we first used post-its to write out all the specific issues. We then used affinity diagram to synthesise the findings into groups of issues following Neilsen's 10 usability heuristics. We also created an Excel spreadsheet to easily see which issues were occuring most often and which had the most sever consequences. As part of the solution we assigned a level of ease of fix to each issue and added specific suggestions on how each of the issues could be either improved or eliminated.</div>

      <h3>What?</h3>
      <div class="WWH" >This was a co-design workshop organised to explore application of interactive technology in designing art and cultural heritage experiences.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <div class="WWH"> I wanted to harness the creativity and design experience of my colleagues to explore the intersection between art, technology and design. The goal of the workshop was to discover and explore speculative design ideas and concepts to expand the design space.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>How?</h3>
      <div class="WWH">I worked in a group with other two people - Yan and Niamh, all of us had a common interest in art and technology. Together we created a presentation introducing the topic and covering information that would be helpful in the design process. We then designed the workshop part dividing the cohort into four groups and giving each group a 'black box' which contained their design brief, images and extra information on topic, cards reminding them about the technology solutions available, feedback forms and some sweets to keep them going!</div>

      </div>
      <p class="carousel-status"></p>
    </div>
	<p>When designing the workshop we had to keep in mind that most of our colleagues would not be familiar with the topics so it was really important for us to provide them with enough information and interesting design probes to get their creativity and ideas going.
	We were impressed by the amount of engagement we saw during the workshop and the quality and creativity of the ideas that came out of it! I truly believe that the extra attention and time that we devoted to design good quality content for the groups to work with, was the key to success.</p>
