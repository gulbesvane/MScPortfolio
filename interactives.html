        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <div class="WWH">This project is an exploration of the use of interactive technology in designing a visitor-focused, memorable and meaningful art-themed experience. My goal is to design a more inclusive art experience that would serve as a gateway for better understanding and enjoyment of art.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h3>What?</h3>
        <div class="WWH">The experience is a process of sensory exploration of the broader themes of painting. The central focus is the immersive and sensory nature of the experience where the visitor is invited to smell, touch, explore and actively engage with the environment around them. I designed and built three interactives: 'Colours and Scents', the 'Artist's Cabinet' and 'Innovation and Art', you can read about the design process and prototyping in the following sections.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h3>How?</h3>
        <div class="WWH">The design process is user-centred, with the subject matter coming from me but the development, prototyping and re-design process guided by the feedback collected from prospective visitors in form of open-ended questionnaires, interviews and user-testing.</div>

    </div>
    <p>To be able to test the concept with prospective visitors under the restrictions introduced due to COVID-19, I made a low-fidelity prototype in form of a cardboard model and filmed a short video explaining each of the interactives and the general concept. This was then sent to people that fit the target audience criteria with questions asking the prospective visitors' thoughts on the general concept, the response towards the chosen topic and opinions about individual interactions.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="white">
    <div  class="Titles">Medium-fidelity prototyping</div>
	  <h5>Colours and Scents</h5>
    <p>The medium-fidelity prototype was made out of cardboard and paper cutouts to cheaply test the concept and technical aspects of the interactive. The stories were researched and the video and audio content were made and edited using <strong>PremierePro and After Effects</strong>.<br><br>
	<strong>Arduino Uno and MPR121</strong> capacitive touch sensor are used to facilitate the physical side of the interaction and communication between <strong>Arduino IDE and Processing</strong> was set-up to control the playback of the video.<br><br>
    For the aroma panel, different scents had to be matched with selected colours and paintings. This involved researching the area of perceived <strong>relationships between colours and scents </strong> and also looking for available suppliers. Twelve final aromas were selected for testing. The aroma bottles were <strong>colour-coded</strong> to gently direct the visitor to the most relevant aromas for the certain painting, but at the same time not physically limiting the choices.

    </div>
	  <h5>Artist's cabinet</h5>
    <p>The interactive was re-designed as individual units to allow a greater number of people to access it without interfering with each other. The feedback from the concept underlined the significance of <strong>tactile interactions</strong> and so to facilitate that the feature of the little pocket and the tactile exploration of the object, related to the story, was added.<br><br>For the prototype, I chose the <strong>Emerald Green colour</strong> because of the interesting but somewhat terrifying story and a chance to create a visually compelling scene. The visitor starts with a tactile exploration of the object in the pocket, then proceeds to find the right <strong>RFID key</strong>  (with the right image) to <strong>unlock the door</strong> of the cabinet.<br><br>
    The user then can pick up the headphones and <strong>listen to the audio story</strong>. The scene inside the box was made from paper cutouts, all the elements in the scene are related to the story. The audio was recorded using the Neuman TLM 103 condenser microphone and edited in Logic ProX, the background music was selected from the <strong>YouTube Music library</strong>.</p>

	  <h5>Innovation and art</h5>
    <p> This turned out to be the most technically challenging interactive. The concept had the visitor exploring different objects in the drawer of the easel and the <strong>interaction with the object</strong> would trigger the relevant story to be projected on the canvas.<br><br>I researched options for a sensor that could do some type of <strong>object recognition</strong> but would work through Bluetooth or WiFi, allowing me to place the MacBook near the projector without the need for the wire between the MacBook and the easel.<br><br> After considering multiple options, I chose the <strong>Nano 33 BLE</strong> and trained it to recognise differently <strong>coloured ID cards</strong>. Next I had to create a stable environment for the sensor so I secured the Nano in a small cardboard box and added small <strong>LED light</strong> on top of the sensor. This worked perfectly resulting in no mistakes in the readings.</p>

    <h5>Colours and Scents</h5>
    <p>In response to the user-testing of the medium-fidelity prototype, a larger painter’s palette was chosen to make the object more obvious to the user and a small sign signifying the touch function of the pallet was added. The frame was made for the TV screen in an attempt to make it look more like a painting, thus signifying that the screen should not be touched. In the aroma panel, small LED lights were added to bring the attention of the user to the colour-coding of the aromas.<br><br> The Processing code had to be adapted to include functionality to switch between multiple videos and to afford more flexibility it was important to make sure that the user would have the ability to re-start and switch to another video at any given moment.</p>

    <p>To increase the quality and to minimise any distractions, the audio was re-recorded in a controlled studio environment using professional-grade audio recording equipment. Another video was made to increase the interaction possibilities for the final testing. The videos were shortened to accommodate more interactions with the painter's palette and to avoid the user getting bored or distracted; the content was adapted to balance the story between descriptive information of the painting and the backstory. You can watch the stories created for this interactive through the link below.</p>

    </div>
    <h5>Artist's cabinet</h5>
    <p>As part of the re-design process, the first challenge was to build the Artist’s cabinet. The high-fidelity prototype box is made out of 9mm plywood with a circular hole cut out in the front door. Based on the feedback from the medium-fidelity prototype testing, the hole for the tactile interaction was fitted with a bright red foam board to immediately attract attention. Where possible, paper cutouts that could be folded into 3d objects were used for the interior, ideally, these would be miniatures of real objects but seeing that this is still a prototype, it didn’t warrant spending money on a concept that might have to change after the next round of testing. A small LED light was fitted on the ceiling to make the scene feel more lively and life-like.</p>

    <p id="audioP">The audio story was shortened and the tone of voice changed to more questioning rather than statement focused. The audio was re-recorded and the narration and background music was levelled and mastered to achieve a more balanced sound. To make a better connection between the audio story and the physical objects in the box the narrator brings the attention of the listener to a particular object in the scene. All the audio has been mixed to listen on headphones.</p>

    <h5>Innovation and art</h5>
    <p>The re-design process for the ‘Innovation and art’ interactive included creating a more sturdy scanning compartment that would be an integrated part of the easel. One section in the drawer was covered with a piece of plywood and a small cutout was made to be used as the insert for the ID cards, a small hole was drilled in the bottom of the drawer to allow USB connection between the laptop and the Nano microcontroller.Two screws were added to the front of the drawer to be used for the placement of the headphones. The two headphones are connected to the laptop by using the headphone splitter. The Processing code used for the 'Colours and Scents' interactive was adapted to handle multiple videos and the Arduino code was fine-tuned to increase the precision of readings. Another video story for the French easel was created and the audio of the first story was re-recorded.</p>
    <div class="carousel-container">

    </div>
    <p>The video material is purposely kept short and plain language and storytelling format are used to introduce new concepts. The main challenge here was to create content that would be interesting and relatable to a person that does not have a huge amount of art knowledge, and in general, would not overwhelm and tire the visitor but rather would naturally complement the tactile interaction with the objects. You can watch the Impressionist introduction video and the French easel story down below.

        <p class="tableTextR">Thankfully, when it was time to test the high fidelity prototype, some of the COVID-19 restrictions had been lifted, so I was able to recruit few people to come and test the experience. With the COVID restrictions, I had to design, build and test the whole project at home. This introduced a lot of restrictions in terms of the available technology, equipment and access to people, however, I put in my utmost effort to bring the interactives to high fidelity level to be able to test the experience 'as in reality'.</p>

        <p class="tableTextL">Alongside developing the individual interactives and resolving all technical issues and challenges I had to think about the experience as a whole and the space in which the interactions take place. The concept of the space is that it is an artist’s studio and the visitors would be able to explore and interact with everything inside the room. This required a lot of creative thinking and DIY solutions to achieve the desired look and feel of the experience. <br><br>
        First I covered all the windows to block out the daylight and to create a sense of 'entering a different space'. When participants came in, they said they felt the space was intimate, dark and atmospheric, so this was an effective way how to emphasise the change.</p>

        <p class="tableTextR"> I used a dark coloured fabric behind the ‘Colours and Scents’ interactive to minimise the distraction caused by the bright wallpaper and to create a more artistic look. For the same reason, on the opposite side of the room, I used a dark red, heavy curtain.<br><br> To emphasise the artistic mood of the room I created a wall papered with sketches and drawings of Impressionist artists and added a small corner space where the participants could draw their sketches and add them to the wall, with this also including an element of participation and breaking the barrier between the audience and the artist.</p>

    <p><strong>The main goal of the ‘experienceART’</strong> project was to use interactive technology, experience design practice and scenography to try and break the preconceptions, behaviours and expectations associated with a traditional art museum experience <strong>to expand the prospective audience</strong>, <strong>encourage active participation</strong> and <strong>exploration of art</strong>. <br><br> The high-fidelity prototype testing demonstrated the still existing challenges in <strong>balancing the ambiguity of interactions</strong> with more visible leads and pointers and overcoming the perceived behavioural norms when around art subjects and objects. However, the project also <strong>proved the success of the concept</strong> as it received very positive and enthusiastic feedback from users at every stage of the testing. <br><br> The level of <strong>engagement and enjoyment</strong> that I saw during the high-fidelity testing was remarkable and the <strong>smiles and enthusiasm</strong> of the visitors made all the countless hours spent researching, coding, prototyping and re-designing absolutely worth it!<br><br> This is just one part of a larger project that I am working on so if you are interested to know more, feel free to contact me. In these isolated times I would be happy to hear from people, share ideas, collaborate and take any suggestions on board.
